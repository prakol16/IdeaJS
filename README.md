IdeaJS
======

A library for developing games based on the HTML5 canvas

FEATURES:
  - Fast background rendering, due to its having two canvases
  - Easy to load sprites
  - Smooth syntax
  - Easy to bind events
  - Cross browser, works on all modern browsers

Using IdeaJS
============

Simply download the source code. You will also need a copy of jQuery 1.7.1 or higher (or you can get the standalone version, which is just a version merged with jQuery.)

Coming Soon
===========

IdeaJS is still being worked on, and you can expect:
  - Much better DOM handling (although the current version supports it, DOM is very buggy right now.)
  - Fixes on a few issues with sprite animation
  - Mobile support
